# AdventOfCode2019
Important notes:
* Day 7 2nd part isn't done, and likely won't be for now
* Day 10 isn't done yet: not working
* Day 11 part 2 is "done", but the computation time is waaaaaay to long. I never got my answer.
* Same for Day 14 part 2
* Day 14 Part 1 needs a way to find the shortest path between start and oxygen system
